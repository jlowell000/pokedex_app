# Pokedex App
Mostly a place for me to practice with HTML/JS.

Started messing around with webpack. If edited run npm commands:

    npm install
    npm run-script build

Some how I've started making a primitive react-like implementation. There is a src/common/Component.js file that acts as the core of the display logic. 
Handles state changes and initializes its child components. As of now state changes can be pushed to childern. To get data back callbacks are used.
